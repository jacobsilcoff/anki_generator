Shock
    • Shock is a clinical syndrome define by the effect of reduced perfusion on organ systems due to a decrease in mean arterial pressures
    • MAP = PDiastolic + 0.3*PPulse
    • Shock with decreased MAP is from either decreased CO or decreased SVR
        ◦ MAP = CO * SVR = HR * SV * SV
        ◦ SV determined by contractility and available blood volume
        ◦ When compensatory responses cannot sufficiently maintain MAP the body presents with shock
    • Three main shock syndromes: Hypovolemic, cardiogenic, distributive
    • The low vascular resistance seen in distributive shock is commonly seen in sepsis but may be mimicked by adrenal crisis or anaphylaxis
    • Shock can occur when systolic BP is < 90 or the MAP is < 70
    • Manifestations of inadequate perfusion:
        ◦ Renal dysfunction (decreased or no urine output)
        ◦ CNS dysfunction (worsening mental status)
        ◦ Tissue hypoxia (lactic acidosis)
History
    • Usually not helpful due do patient being delirious due to decreased perfusion, but important features:
        ◦ Recent use/discontinued use of coritcosteroids (adrenal crisis)
        ◦ Ingestion of certain foods or drugs or the occurrence of bee sting (anaphylaxis)
        ◦ History of chest pain (pleuritic: PE or tension pneumothorax; nonpleuritic:ischemia)
        ◦ Recent urinary tract or other infection (sepsis)
        ◦ Recent bleeding or gastrointestinal volume loss (esophageal varices, cholera)
Physical Exam
    • Low BP, compensatory tachycardia
    • Pulsus paradoxus: cardiac taponade (decrease of systolic BP > 10 mmHg on inspiration)
    • JVP provides rough estimate of central venous pressure and shock type (table above)
    • No breath sounds on one side and tracheal deviation on opposite side = tension pneumothorax
